# Brick Dashboard

This is the dashboard powering my project [Brick](https://github.com/afonsoingles/brick-core). This dashboard was nearly **entirely made with AI. (Amp)**. This is because I'm mainly focusing on writing the backend logic, and I didn't want to write an UI.

### Run this

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env`
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```
This API URL should be your backend (brick-core) URL.

4. Start it:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will show up at `http://localhost:3000`
